# launchControllerJs
Novation LaunchController wrapper for Javascript. Primarily targeted at p5.js

Please note that using MIDI in the browser has very limited support. 
I tested only with Chrome 70.

**This is still work in progress**


# Testing if it works...

1. Connect your Launch Control to your computer
2. Using a supported browser, navigate to xxx
3. If prompted, give permission to the web site to access MIDI devices
